# food-reports

This project was generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.15.1. 

But I add the directives with a more modularized way.

The Gruntfile.js was modified to reach the css inside a directives.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
