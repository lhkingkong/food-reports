# food-reports

This project was generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.15.1. 

I add the directives with a more modularized way, so, the **Gruntfile.js** was modified to reach the css inside a directives.

## Build & development

Run `grunt build` to create a **dist** folder which you can open the index.html with your browser to start the application.

Run `grunt serve` for preview.

## Unit tests (in construction)

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
